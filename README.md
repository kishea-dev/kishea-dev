👋 Hello! I'm Moses Kisya, a passionate Full Stack Developer and seasoned IT consultant with a strong foundation in software engineering. I'm proud to hold a degree from Makerere University, where I graduated in 2014, and since then, I've been on an exciting journey in the world of technology.

💼 Over the course of my career, I've honed my skills and expertise in various areas, including:

- **C#**: I've consistently demonstrated my ability to develop robust, scalable, and efficient applications using C#. Whether it's creating desktop software, web applications, or mobile apps, my commitment to delivering high-quality solutions remains unwavering.

- **React Native**: With React Native, I've harnessed the power of React to build cross-platform mobile applications. This enables me to create versatile and responsive apps that can reach a broader audience.

- **PHP**: My proficiency in PHP has allowed me to craft dynamic web applications and websites. From server-side scripting to seamless database integration, I've tackled diverse web development challenges.

🌐 Beyond my technical expertise, I'm a firm believer in the potential of technology to improve lives and create positive change. I'm dedicated to using my skills to contribute to innovative solutions that make a meaningful impact.

🎵 When I'm not immersed in code, you'll often find me indulging in my love for Christian gospel music. I'm passionate about its ability to inspire and uplift, and I occasionally share my musical talents by playing the piano.

🎮 I also find relaxation in the virtual worlds of video games. Exploring new realms, solving puzzles, and embracing the challenges of gaming are some of my favorite pastimes.

❌ Dislikes:
- Negativity and hate speech: I'm committed to fostering a positive and inclusive online community where constructive dialogue thrives.
- Ungrateful behavior: Gratitude is a virtue I hold dear, and I appreciate the value of humility and thankfulness.
